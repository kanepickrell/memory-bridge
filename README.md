# 🧠 Memory Bridge AI

## **Project Overview**  
Memory Bridge AI is an AI-powered memory reinforcement system designed to help individuals in care facilities strengthen recall and rediscover past memories. Unlike traditional chatbots, it builds an evolving memory graph, tracking relationships between people, places, and events, reinforcing weaker memories, and integrating family-uploaded images for rediscovery.

## **Key Features**
 **Graph-Based Memory Storage** – AI creates a **network of linked memories**  
 **Conversational Memory Recall** – AI **remembers past interactions** and revisits memories for **reinforcement**  
 **Recall Strengthening & Testing** – AI uses **adaptive recall difficulty** (Recognition → Cued Recall → Free Recall)  
 **Image Upload & Rediscoverable Memories** – Family members upload photos, and AI **uses them as recall prompts**  
 **Memory Graph Visualization** – The graph **dynamically updates in real-time** to show how memories connect

## **Tech Stack**
| **Component** | **Technology** |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Backend (Memory Storage & Retrieval)** | JSON (for MVP), NetworkX (graph model), Flask |
| **Conversational AI** | OpenAI GPT-4 API (or Mistral-7B), LangChain |
| **Recall Reinforcement** | AI uses **adaptive recall logic** based on user responses |
| **Frontend (UI & Graph Visualization)** | Flask (chat UI), Plotly Dash (interactive graph) |
| **Image Upload & Retrieval** | Flask file handling, stored image metadata in JSON |

## **Team Roles & Responsibilities**
| **Team Member** | **Role** | **Tasks** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **vera or kane** | **Conversational AI & Memory Recall** | Implements chatbot logic, adaptive recall, connects AI with memory graph |
| **EJ** | **Memory Graph & Visualization** | Creates and updates NetworkX-based memory graph, builds interactive visualization |
| **vera or kane** | **Chat UI & Image Upload** | Develops chatbot interface, image upload portal, integrates visualization |

## **8-Hour Plan: Get a Working MVP**
This plan ensures a **basic working prototype** that can **store and retrieve memories, reinforce recall, and display a simple graph.**

| **Time Block** | **Task** | **Who Works on It?** |
|--------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Hour 1-2** | Set up project structure (Flask backend, chatbot API, JSON storage) | **All team members** |
| **Hour 3-4** | Implement **basic memory graph storage (JSON/NetworkX)** | **EJ** |
| **Hour 3-4** | Develop **basic chatbot API** that references stored memories | **kane/vera** |
| **Hour 5-6** | Create **Flask-based chat UI** for interacting with AI | **kane/vera** |
| **Hour 6-7** | Implement **static memory visualization (Plotly/Matplotlib)** | **EJ** |
| **Hour 7-8** | **End-to-end testing & debugging** | **All team members** |

 **By Hour 8, We Can Demo:**  
1 User **enters a memory** in the chat UI.  
2 AI **remembers & references it later**.  
3 The **memory graph updates & displays connections**.

## **24-Hour Plan: Full Scientific Version**
After the **MVP is working**, we **enhance the project** with features backed by **modern Alzheimer's therapy research**.

| **Time Block** | **Feature** | **Why It’s Important?** | **Who Works on It?** |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Hour 9-12** |  **Dynamic Recall Testing** (Recognition → Cued Recall → Free Recall) | **Better memory reinforcement based on cognitive therapy** | **AI Developer** |
| **Hour 9-12** |  **Image Upload for Rediscovery** | **Adds personal touch, aligns with reminiscence therapy** | **Frontend Dev + Data Scientist** |
| **Hour 13-16** |  **Confidence Tracking for Memory Integrity** | **Prevents AI from reinforcing false memories** | **AI Developer** |
| **Hour 13-16** |  **Graph Enhancements (Live Updates & Clickable Nodes)** | **More interactive & visually compelling** | **Data Scientist** |
| **Hour 17-20** |  **Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) Features** | **Aligns with Alzheimer’s research, makes AI-backed exercises more engaging** | **AI Developer** |
| **Hour 17-20** |  **Music-Based Memory Recall (Music Therapy)** | **Evidence-backed approach to memory retrieval** | **Frontend + AI Developer** |
| **Hour 21-24** |  **Final Testing, Bug Fixes, and UI Polish** | **Ensures smooth demo experience** | **All team members** |

## **Scientific Enhancements in the 24-Hour Plan**
Modern memory therapy methods help us align with existing Alzheimer’s research while keeping our innovation intact. Here’s how we integrate proven therapy techniques into our project:

### **1. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) Features**
- AI **introduces theme-based memory exercises** (e.g., "Tell me about a childhood holiday").  
- **Why It’s Important:** **Gives our project clinical credibility**.

### **2. Music-Based Memory Recall (Music Therapy)**
- **How We Implement It:** Allow family members to **tag memories with music**.  
- **Why It’s Important:** **Scientifically backed as a powerful memory trigger**.  

### **3. Confidence Tracking for Memory Integrity**
- **Prevents AI from reinforcing false memories** by **tracking recall confidence & flagging inconsistencies**.

## **Hackathon Demo Plan**
 **Live Walkthrough:**  
1 User **shares a memory** (*"I went to Paris with Lisa in 1998."*).  
2 **Memory Graph updates** with nodes for **Lisa, Paris, and 1998**.  
3 AI later **tests recall** → *"Who was with you on that trip?"*  
4 **Family uploads a photo** → AI uses it for rediscovery.  
5 **Graph visualization updates dynamically**, showing **stronger recall links**.  

---

## **goals**
 **MVP in 8 Hours:** Guarantees **a working demo** with a chatbot + memory graph.  
 **24-Hour Enhancements:** Adds **scientific credibility** using **real therapeutic techniques**.  
 **Emotional Connection:** Family uploads + music recall = **more engaging & human-centered**.  
 **Visually Impactful:** Memory Graph + Image Prompts = **impressive for judges**.  

---

### **Next Steps**
- **Confirm JSON vs. Neo4j for memory storage** (stick with JSON for MVP).  
- **Define chatbot’s structured recall prompts** for CST-based memory exercises. 
- **Finalize the UI for family uploads & visualization display.**
