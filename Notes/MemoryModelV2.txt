Memory Map Data Structure

The memory map consists of three primary entity types: People, Events, and Locations. Each entity contains specific attributes and interconnections that define relationships and associations.

1. Person

A Person represents an individual with whom memories and events are associated.

Attributes:

id (string): A unique identifier for the person.

name (string): The full name of the person.

age (integer): The person's age.

relationship (string): The nature of the relationship with this person (e.g., friend, family, colleague).

description (string): A brief description of the person.

tags (list of strings): Keywords associated with the person.

recall_strength (float, 0.0 to 1.0): A normalized weight representing the recall strength of this person.

2. Event

An Event represents a memory or occurrence involving one or more people at one or more locations.

Attributes:

id (string): A unique identifier for the event.

date (string, YYYY-MM-DD): The date the event took place.

related_people (list of tuples): A list of associated people, each represented as a tuple (person_id, relation_weight) where relation_weight is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

description (string): A summary of the event.

tags (list of strings): Keywords associated with the event.

related_places (list of tuples): A list of associated locations, each represented as a tuple (location_id, relation_weight).

recall_strength (float, 0.0 to 1.0): A normalized weight representing the recall strength of this event.

3. Location

A Location represents a physical place where events have occurred.

Attributes:

id (string): A unique identifier for the location.

name (string): The name of the location.

address (string): The address or general description of the location.

description (string): A summary of the significance of the location.

recall_strength (float, 0.0 to 1.0): A normalized weight representing the recall strength of this location.

This structure ensures that events, people, and locations are interconnected while maintaining a weighted representation of their significance in memory.
